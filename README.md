# FIFA-WORLD-CUP-ANALYSIS (Data Analytics Team 2)
Football World Cup also called FIFA meaning Federation Internationale de Football Association, is an international association football competition contested by the senior menâ€™s national teams. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 which explains the gaps in our analysis, this was due to the Second World War.

# Background and Findings
As a team, work on a football world cup analysis using data from 1930 till the present. Scrap, clean, and visualize with Power BI. <br />
Your dashboard must show the following: <br />
Number of world cup winning title. <br />
Attendance. <br />
Number of teams. <br />
Goals and matches per cup. <br />
Goals per team per world cup. <br />
Matches with the highest attendance. <br />
Stadium with the highest average attendance. <br />
Which countries had won the world cup. <br />
Number of goals per country and match outcome by home and away. <br />

# Data Sourcing and Cleaning
The dataset was gotten from Kaggle. <br />
The process of cleaning the dataset was done partly on Excel and most of it was done on Power bi, the 2018 dataset was missing we had to source for it online, then removed the columns that are not needed and duplicates was removed, then the dataset was loaded into Power bi query where we corrected the spelling errors, removed the time from the date column, added a new column which we called fixtures that gotten from the away team name and home team name, added another column called unique fixture this was gotten by merging the fixture and match ID.
